Welcome to Resesif 👍!

Resesif is a dark color scheme based on the Textmate Resesif for Sublime Text.

To enable and use the color scheme, you will need to edit Preferences.sublime-settings,
that can be accessed from Sublime Text > Preferences > Settings - User.

Add/change the "color_scheme" line with:

{
    "color_scheme": "Packages/User/resesif-extended.tmTheme"
}

Save the file, restart your Sublime Text and you're ready to go!.

The color scheme supports a lot of languages and different scopes, you can know more about
Resesif at the github repository <https://github.com/carloscuesta/resesif>.

You can find me on Twitter @crloscuesta and Github @carloscuesta.
